// We’ll listen on port 3000 instead of the standard ports 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) because those would typically be
// used for an app’s front end.
//
// Why Port 3000?
// There is no rule that the port should be 3000—if unspecified, an arbitrary port will be assigned—but 3000 is used
// throughout the documentation examples for both Node.js and Express.js, so we continue the tradition here.
//
// Can Node.js Share Ports With the Front End?
// We can still run locally at a custom port, even when we want our back end to respond to requests on standard ports.
// This would require a reverse proxy to receive requests on port 80 or 443 with a specific domain or a subdomain. It
// would then redirect them to our internal port 3000.
